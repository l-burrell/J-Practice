Strings are Immutable ( Meaning they cannot be changed once created )
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	New developers often try to modifiy an existing string by using the addition operator or the equal operator. 
	
	Example: 
		String name = "tim"; // creation of the string 
		name = "tim warner"; // modify the string
	
	However, we are not actually modifying the string! Instead a new string is created with the data from the previous string. 
	
	This gives the appearance that the string has been modified but in reality it is a totally different string.
	
	Obviously this is inefficient to create a new string each time we would like to append data to an exisiting string. A better approach would be to use the StringBuffer.

	
Strings are not a primitive data type. 
----------------------------------------------------------
	String as not considered a primitive data type. It is an array of characters. 
	
	Strings are a great example of a class being built using primitive data types, to essentially create a totally new data type. This allows use to take advantage of the primitive data and essentially make tools for future development by creating a new data type to speed up development.
