Notice that each data type's minimum value and maximum value can be found using 
the wrapper class and the MIN_VALUE or MAX_VALUE function. This is useful for determining 
which data type we want to use for saving memory.

Overflowing / UnderFlowing
--------------------------
	- Overflow is when we try to add more data then the maximum can hold, and thus it simply displays the maximum value. 
	
	- Underflow is when we try to subtract or use less than the minimum value that the data type can hold. Thus only displaying the minimum value.
	
	- Both Overflowing and Underflowing will lose data! It is important to use proper data types for holding this data so that we dont run into these issues.
	
Lossy Conversions when casting
----------------------------------
	You are dealing with lossy data when you store data in the incorrect data type. For example, think about when you have a double with the value 5.6 and try to store that data into an integer. 
	
	This would essentially put the value 5 into the integer and lose the 0.6 it originally had. This is lossy data. 
	
	It is bad practice to lose data like this so you should always store data appropriately.
